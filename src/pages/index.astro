      <p>
        The Kiraethana Mosque complex (Beglučka Džamija) is located in the sparsely populated village of Begluci, Bosnia
        and Herzegovina. The mosque was built on the site of a previous mosque that had stood for nearly 200 years
        before being destroyed during the war of 1992-1995. Today, the mosque complex serves as a gathering place for
        the community, not only for prayer but also for community events. The complex also aims to welcome guests from
        the Bosnian diaspora, encouraging them to contribute to the growing Kiraethana collection.

        The complex includes the Kiraethana Mosque, an Ablution pavilion, and the Riverside pavilion along the Ukrina
        River. The mosque covers a net area of 176.30 square meters. As a programmatic add-on, apart from an apartment
        for contributing guests, architects have incorporated a Kiraethana—a library and reading space—addressing the
        region's lack of modern library facilities. Therefore, the Surah "Iqra Bismi Rabbika" ("Read! In the Name of
        Your Lord") is featured in three forms: as a short inscription in stone above the entrance, as an expanded
        version upon entry, and as the full Surah crowning the prayer hall.

      <p>
        Beyond merely rebuilding a religious structure, the project aims to become a catalyst for community unification
        and education. By integrating a library and reading room (Kiraethana) into the modest design, the mosque now
        serves as a hub for knowledge exchange, fostering deeper social connections within the local community. If you
        would like to contribute to the development of this complex, either by donation or by adding to the Kiraethana
        collection, please&nbsp;contact&nbsp;us.
